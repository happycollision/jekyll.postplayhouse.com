## Actor Auditions

### __Crawford, NE --- Saturday May 6, 2017__

Auditions will be held at Post Playhouse at the following times:

* Session 1 --- 10:00am to noon
* Session 2 --- 1:00pm to 3:00pm

No appointment is necessary for local auditions. Please come about 15 minutes early to either session to fill out some paperwork. We may not use all of the time allotted for each session, but please do plan on being there the whole time.

Please wear closed-toe shoes (sneakers are best; no sandals, please), and clothing that you can move in comfortably.

Bring a headshot (or current picture of just you) and resum&eacute; if you have them. If you do not have them, you will still be considered, so do not worry.
