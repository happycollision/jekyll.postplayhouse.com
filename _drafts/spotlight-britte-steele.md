### How Long Have You Been Working Professionally in Theatre?
My first "professional" paying job was the summer after my sophomore year in college at the Adirondack Repertory Theatre— I graduated and began working more frequently as a professional in 2010! 

### What is your favorite experience in theatre?
A recent favorite experience was this past Holiday season— I was in "A Christmas Carol" and playing the hostess of a big Christmas party within the show— Mrs Fezziwig! She is so full of love and so cheerful— a role I love performing! Anyways, after our Christmas day matinee a patron approached me— she wanted to let me know how much she enjoyed the "party" onstage—she came to the show on her own and did not have family to spend the holidays with, but the show got her into the holiday spirit and she was part our little family, if only for a few hours. This— renewing joy and lifting people's spirits— makes being a performer so rewarding for me! 

### What keeps bringing you back to Post Playhouse?
The people— onstage and off! Everyone is great at what they do, and so excited to be a part of the theatre in whatever capacity they are involved. The board and community are so supportive of what the theatre is to the community, and that is truly special— that doesn't happen everywhere, believe me! It doesn't hurt that the area is gorgeous, either! 

### Was it a big culture shock coming to Post?
Well, last year Tom was great about explaining exactly what to expect, but you really have to experience it firsthand! I thought it would be a big adjustment for me, but since I love being outdoors and we really got into rehearsals right away, I adjusted pretty quickly! 

### Have you ever been to this part of the country before?
Well, the last time I was on a national tour, we played Omaha, and also drove through Scotts Bluff, so yes but no! Also, I lived in Colorado when I was younger, so we would take family trips close to this area! 

### What other jobs do you do in theatre?
Well, the biggest thing I do is hairstyling and wigs! I have always loved it, and pursued getting more training in college while I was also in the theatre performance program. I have also been a child wrangler, and teach dance for children ages 3-8 when I am in NYC!

### What are you passionate about/hobbies/interests/jobs outside of theatre?
I am passionate about doing life with people— about getting to know others and live life to the fullest each day—you can't put your spare time in a bank somewhere! I also love the outdoors and am a certified kayaking and whitewater rafting instructor. I am always reading a new book—

### What types of roles do you normally play?
Hmmm— I seem to get cast in character roles! I really enjoy finding a character's reality, no matter how crazy it seems to a 'normal' person, and just acting that out!
I am playing against my normal type this season in general, but finding connection and honesty with the other people in each scene, whether silly or serious, is my ultimate goal, and I am looking forward to it! 

### What role do you hope most to play someday?
Someday I hope to play Mama Rose in Gypsy. She is such a complex, passionate character, and I love the music in that show! My ultimate goal as a child was to play Fagin in Oliver— I'm not letting that one go yet either;)
