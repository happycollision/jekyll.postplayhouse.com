### Tell us a little bit about what it is like working at Post Playhouse.

This is my first season at the Post Playhouse.  I am enjoying every minute of it.  It's not been so much of a culture shock for me since I grew up in a small town in North Carolina.  Growing up I was surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Even though the view is varied in color and the geography is diverse, I still have a feeling of peace and tranquility surrounding me here in Crawford.  I will say having no gym is the hardest obstacle to overcome.  However, I just move my exercise outdoors to hiking the trails, riding my bike, and swimming laps in the area pools.  That, along with the friendly faces around town, make spending the summer here feel like a wonderful "home" away from home.  

### Have you travelled a lot working in theatre?

I have several "homes" away from home.  I've spent the last 15 years or so on the road with my career.  I graduated from Lees-McRae College in North Carolina with a Bachelor of Science in Musical Theater and Dance.  I hit the open road, traveling from theater to theater, with a couple of suitcases, dance shoes, and musical instruments.  Along my “ride” and journey, I've performed, choreographed and directed in over 130 productions, about 15 states, and with one touring company across this amazing country.  I feel as though I've seen and lived it all:  big cities, small towns, lakes, mountains, deserts.  I've taken with me the best experiences and memories anyone could ask for.  

### How long have you been in the business?

I have been working professionally in theater since I was 18 years old.  My first paycheck was $98.15, and I felt on top of the world.  I had just completed my freshman year of college.  After auditioning as a "dancer only" at the Southeastern Theater Conference (SETC), Papermill Playhouse, a quaint theater in New Hampshire, hired me to perform in three shows:  *Anything Goes*, *She Loves Me*, and *West Side Story*.  From that moment on, I caught the bug and knew there was nothing else I wanted for a career.

### What is one of your favorite memories from all your years as a theatre professional?

My favorite experience in theater was the first time I actually saw an opening night as the director of Bigfork Summer Playhouse's *Beauty And The Beast*.  I had been choreographing shows for years.  The only downfall was I never witnessed the final product.  I was always hired as an actor to be in the shows I choreographed.  In the rehearsal process, I could occasionally take myself out of the numbers to watch and make sure all was progressing to the director's liking.  However, I could *never* see the final product.  The day arrived June in 2007, opening night of *Beauty And The Beast*.  I was finally able to see the magic. To sit in the theater and actually view all the hard work that lead up to this one moment was exhilarating.  I was so proud of the cast, the design team, and the crew.

### This year you are taking on several jobs at Post Playhouse. How did you come to a place in your career where you can take on so many jobs?

I've been lucky enough to branch out in my performing arts career.  While performing at a theater in North Carolina, I was able to manage the publicity department, sell ads for the programs, organize fundraisers and galas, as well as teach dance to local adults and children.  In Illinois and Wisconsin, while working as an actor, I led camps to instruct stage combat and dance.  I served as company manager for a 2000 seat amphitheater in Utah, where I had the privilege of meeting several movie stars and iconic musicians such as Bill Cosby and Huey Lewis.  All of these side jobs have improved my skills and helped me to acquire the role of Managing Director for Post Playhouse.  Some of my duties include working in the box office helping with ticket sales, making sure radio and newspaper ads are emailed on time, and providing a nice workspace for the actors and staff.  You name it, I will try my best to get it done!
