### How long have you been working professionally in theatre?
I had my first professional gig when I was 17, the summer before my freshman year of college. I sang Tony in the Atlanta Symphony's concert style performance of *West Side Story*.
 
### What is your favorite experience in theatre?
I got a grant from New York University to research and stage the musical *She Loves Me* by Bock and Harnick. I got to meet and interview Sheldon Harnick, then direct and perform in one of my favorite musicals. It's amazing how much deeper you appreciate a show when you fully understand the work that went into creating it.
 
### Was it a big culture shock coming out to Post?
I had to get reacquainted with the small town pace and feel, after living in New York City for the last two years, but I'm from Georgia where there are lots of towns about this size. I've actually worked for two summers at a theatre in Sandersville, GA which reminds me a lot of Crawford.
 
### What was the toughest thing to get used to out here?
Not living directly above a coffee shop, pub, and Dunkin' Donuts as I did in NYC. Haha! Also, it gets very dark and quiet here at night. New York is never either of those things. It makes it so easy to fall asleep here.
 
### Have you ever been to this part of the country before?
I have not! Eastern Iowa is as far west as I've ever been. I'm not widely travelled within the U.S. so this is very exciting for me.
 
### What are you passionate about, theatre or otherwise?
As nerdy as this sounds, vocal technique is something that really excites me. I grew up listening to opera and was fascinated by their voices, which is what made me want to pursue performing. NYU has several teachers who arÃªte ally on the cutting edge of voice science so I was able to learn so much during my time there. Now I have lots of fun, really weird vocal exercises that I do constantly (as the rest of the cast can attest to).
 
### Where have you traveled to work in the theatre?
Crawford, NE. Other than that I've only worked in Georgia and New York while I lived there so I feel like that isn't traveling.
 
### What are your hobbies/interests/jobs outside theatre?
I love reading and I'm currently working on *The Hobbit* and *Anne of Green Gables* which I just realized are both children's literature. I play video games which has been a big pastime in the guys' house. We're thinking about starting a tournament. I really like working out. That's how I de-stress. I'm actually planning on getting my personal training certification when I get back to New York.
 
 
### What types of roles do you normally play?
I tend to play "boyfriends". Haha! Young, usually painfully nice, slightly awkward young men who are searching for something (spoiler alert: it's a woman). Applicable skills include falling in love with complete strangers and singing duets (with said strangers).
 
### If you are playing against your normal type at all, what are your thoughts on changing it up?
It's been a learning experience playing Kenickie. He's a really different energy than me. I'm really quiet, friendly, and not aggressive in life, and most of the characters I play are a lot like that. Kenickie is the opposite of all that. He's loud, aggressive, and probably the meanest of the "Burger Palace Boys". He's mean to his girlfriend (he and Rizzo break up twice in the show), starts a fight with Rodger, and pretty much yells at everyone throughout the show. It takes a lot of work and thought to find that in myself.
 
### Which role are you most looking forward to this summer?
The Prince in Cinderella is really exciting to me. He's right in the center of my type and a lot of theaters are going to be producing that play now that it has closed on Broadway. Plus, he sings some of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most iconic songs.
 
### What role do you hope most to play someday?
Probably Monty Navarro in *A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder*. I've seen it twice and think it's hilarious with a great book and score. It's really exciting that there is a show on Broadway that is so reminiscent of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, but for contemporary audiences.
