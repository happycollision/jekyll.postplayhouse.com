    Don is happy to be returning to Post Playhouse for another amazing summer! Since last summer, Don has been seen in Chicago playing Sir Bliant in *Camelot* at Drury Lane Theatre and in Rock Island, IL playing Jean Valjean in *Les Miserables*. The best thing to happen since last summer, though? Don became an uncle because Dan Denton became a father. Thanks to Tom and all the staff at Post. Thanks to mom, dad, Dan, Amber, and little Oliver. Thanks to Kim, WP, Peter, and Carol. Thanks to God.
