#     Michael is ecstatic to be a part of the Post Playhouse this year!  Growing up in Chadron, he has always enjoyed watching the shows every summer, and is very excited to now have the chance to perform on the stage so close to home. Currently pursuing a degree in Musical Theatre at Nebraska Wesleyan University, Michael couldn’t be happier than to experience his first professional show so close to friends and family. He cannot thank Tom enough for welcoming him, and for the board members always having an open theatre for all to enjoy!
