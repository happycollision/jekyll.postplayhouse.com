I thoroughly enjoy any time I can get with my three grown children, Hans lives in Washington DC and works in the Senate, Blake is a Senior at Chadron State College, and Emily is a Freshman at Chadron State College. I am a member of the Hemingford Methodist Church and on the Supervisory Committee at the Hemingford Community Federal Credit Union. I love the outdoors through gardening, flowers, and traveling. I am co-owner of a not-for-profit fitness center, The Body Shop, where I enjoy keeping active by taking classes and walking.
