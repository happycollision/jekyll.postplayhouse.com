### Group Rates

Groups of 25 or more may purchase tickets at the rate noted above. Tickets may be added to a group sale (if seats are available) up to show date but are never reduced or refunded. The Post Playhouse cannot be responsible for unused group tickets.

Group rate tickets can not be purchased online. Please email us for group rate ticket needs at <a href="mailto:tickets@postplayhouse.com">tickets@postplayhouse.com</a> or call our box office {{ site.box_office_phone }}.


## Subscription Pricing

Subscriptions are the best way to see what Post Playhouse has to offer each summer! With a Season Subscription, you get drastically discounted tickets on 4 or 5 different productions of your choosing. And since you don't have to pick your dates or seats at the time of purchase, they make great gifts.

### Season Subscriptions {{ site.season }}

Please choose from the following shows to fill out your season subscription:

{% assign productions = site.data.productions[site.season] | sort: "opening" %}
{%- for production in productions -%}
1. {{ production.title }}
{% endfor %}


Please remember that seats can only be reserved based on availability, so call the box office to secure your seats. Also note, as stated above, subscriptions may only be used on 4 or 5 *different productions*. This means they cannot be used to see the same production multiple times.
