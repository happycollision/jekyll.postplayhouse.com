### Group Rates

Groups of 25 or more may purchase tickets at the rate noted above. Tickets may be added to a group sale (if seats are available) up to show date but are never reduced or refunded. The Post Playhouse cannot be responsible for unused group tickets. 

Group rate tickets can not be purchased online. Please email us for group rate ticket needs at <a href="mailto:tickets@postplayhouse.com">tickets@postplayhouse.com</a> or call our box office 308-665-1976.


## Subscription Pricing

Subscriptions are the best way to see what Post Playhouse has to offer each summer! With a Season Subscription, you get drastically discounted tickets on 4 or 5 different productions of your choosing. And since you don't have to pick your dates or seats at the time of purchase, they make great gifts.
