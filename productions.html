        Here is Rydell High’s senior class of 1959: duck-tailed, hot-rodding “Burger Palace Boys” and their gum-snapping, hip-shaking “Pink Ladies” in bobby sox and pedal pushers, evoking the look and sound of the 1950s in this rollicking musical. Head “greaser” Danny Zuko and new (good) girl Sandy Dumbrowski try to relive the high romance of their “Summer Nights” as the rest of the gang sings and dances its way through such songs as “Greased Lightnin’”, “It’s Raining on Prom Night”, “Alone at the Drive-In Movie” recalling the music of Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Elvis Presley that became the soundtrack of a generation. An 8-year run on Broadway and two subsequent revivals along with innumerable school and community productions place 
        <em>
          Grease
        </em>
        among the world’s most popular musicals.

      <p>
        Based on the film A Man Of No Importance
      </p>

      <p>
        This tender story of family, friendship and acceptance teaches us that it really is a wonderful thing to “love who you love.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Winner of the 2003 Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Musical, 
        <em>
          A Man Of No Importance
        </em>
        is the second successful collaboration by the team of Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, all of whom won TONY Awards for Ragtime.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alfie Byrne is a bus driver in 1964 Dublin, whose heart holds secrets he can’t share with anyone but his imagined confidante, Oscar Wilde. When he attempts to put on an amateur production of Wilde’s 
        <em>
          Salome
        </em>
        in the local church hall, he confronts the forces of bigotry and shame over a love “that dare not speak its name.”
      </p>

      <p>
        A Man Of No Importance is a rare gem in the canon of musical theater, one which combines the depth and drama of a play with the lyricism and comedy of a musical. A tender and beautifully woven tale of love, friendship and coming to terms with who we are that is sure to move and inspire audiences.

        Inspired by and featuring the songs of Elvis Presley. It’s 1955, and into a square little town in a square little state rides a guitar-playing roustabout who changes everything and everyone he meets in this hip-swiveling, lip-curling musical fantasy that’ll have you jumpin’ out of your blue suede shoes with such classics as “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Jailhouse Rock,” and “Don’t Be Cruel.”

        Based on a story by Larry L. King
      </p>

      <p>
        Popularized by the movie starring Dolly Parton, this happy go lucky view of small town vice and statewide political side-stepping recounts the good times and the demise of the Chicken Ranch, known since the 1850s as one of the better pleasure palaces in all of Texas. Governors, senators, mayors, and even victorious college football teams frequent Miss Mona’s cozy bordello until that puritan nemesis Watchdog focuses his television cameras and his righteous indignation on the institution.

        “A font of fun and friendliness, engagingly rich in regional nostalgia and spiced with delicate bawdry. The country and western score is a delight.” – Time

        The timeless enchantment of a magical fairy tale is reborn with the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein hallmarks of originality, charm and elegance. Originally presented on television in 1957 starring Julie Andrews, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein’s <em>Cinderella</em> was the most widely viewed program in the history of the medium. Its recreation in 1965 starring Lesley Ann Warren was no less successful in transporting a new generation to the miraculous kingdom of dreams-come-true, and so was a second remake in 1997, which starred Brandy as Cinderella and Whitney Houston as her Fairy Godmother. As adapted for the stage, with great warmth and more than a touch of hilarity, the hearts of children and adults alike still soar when the slipper fits.
