<h2>What's with the “grey” shows?</h2>

<p>Post Playhouse is proud to announce that we're taking the show on the road! This summer, we will be having several evening performances of Church Basement Ladies and Damn Yankees in Custer and Lead, South Dakota. Those performances are marked in grey in the calendar below. DY stands for Damn Yankees, and CBL stands for Church Basement Ladies.</p>
